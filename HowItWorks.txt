Architecture Overview

C++ Algorithm Core:

Your existing C++ code (improvingalgo.cpp, own_benchmark.cpp, etc.) performs the heavy computation (Dinic's algorithm).
It will be modified to print JSON updates representing the state of the algorithm (e.g., node visited, edge flow changed, current path) to its standard output (stdout). Each update should be a single line of JSON.
FastAPI Backend (Python):

Acts as an intermediary web server.
It will expose a WebSocket endpoint that your Next.js frontend can connect to.
It will have an HTTP endpoint (or receive a WebSocket message) to trigger the C++ algorithm.
When triggered, FastAPI will run your compiled C++ executable as a subprocess.
FastAPI will capture the stdout from the C++ subprocess. As JSON updates come in from C++ stdout, FastAPI will parse them and forward them over the WebSocket to the connected Next.js frontend.
Next.js Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript):

The user interface built with React/Next.js.
Connects to the FastAPI WebSocket endpoint.
Receives JSON updates and uses a graph visualization library (like React Flow, Cytoscape.js, etc.) to render and update the graph live.
Sends a message (via HTTP or WebSocket) to FastAPI to start/control the algorithm.
Advantages of this Approach:

Clear Separation of Concerns:
C++ handles the complex algorithm efficiently.
FastAPI handles web communication (HTTP, WebSockets), process management, and acts as a robust API layer. Python is excellent for these tasks.
Next.js handles the user interface and presentation.
Leverage Strengths: You use C++ for performance-critical computation, Python/FastAPI for its ease of web development and async capabilities, and Next.js/React for building modern UIs.
Simplified C++: Your C++ code doesn't need to implement a WebSocket server directly. It just needs to print structured JSON to stdout, which is much simpler.
Robust Communication: WebSockets are ideal for real-time, bidirectional communication needed for live updates.
CORS Management: FastAPI makes it easy to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which is necessary when your Next.js frontend (e.g., on localhost:3000) communicates with your FastAPI backend (e.g., on localhost:8000).




Development Workflow

Compile C++ Code: Ensure your C++ program (e.g., own_benchmark) is compiled and prints JSON updates to stdout.
Set CPP_EXECUTABLE Path: Correctly set the CPP_EXECUTABLE variable in your FastAPI main.py.
Run FastAPI Backend: uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
Run Next.js Frontend: npm run dev (or yarn dev)
Open your Next.js app in the browser (usually http://localhost:3000).
Trigger the "start algorithm" command from your Next.js UI.
FastAPI will launch the C++ subprocess, capture its JSON output, and stream it to your Next.js app via WebSockets for live visualization.
